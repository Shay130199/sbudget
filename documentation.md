##  Introduction


According to the Student Money Survey 2022, results have shown that three in four university students struggle to understand how to budget which stems from never being taught about it from an early age (Save the Student, 2022). The consequences students tend to face when they do not the budget is a lack of savings, out-of-control spending, getting into debt, and financial stress.  What if there was a solution to this where Solent students have a better understanding of how to budget, learn the value of money, have financial guidance, and control what they spend? Students need to know that It is just as crucial as studies as it is a life skill everyone has to know.


Throughout this report, the aim of the outcome is to create a responsive single-page web budgeting application (SPA) that will support Solent university students to save more money. 
Elements that will be involved to complete this task by overarching a method or methodology that will help begin planning the web application for students. This has to be a design thinking method to support your user's needs. This is followed by an argument of why the method that was used in this project was used.
Along the line of the process, there will be a brief discussion about how the ethical considerations and acknowledgement gained ethical clearance. In addition to that, there has to be a section where results are discussed from the surveys and interviews to know the users’ needs. Once the research has been accomplished, a well-functioned prototype should be designed and user testing will take place.

##  Agile and Design thinking Methodologies

 the two main methodologies are compatible with this idea would be design thinking and Agile Methodology. 

In the DT methodology, the first stage is to empathise. Qualitative and quantitative research would help conduct data on the user's needs and feelings towards budgeting. This will be a non-biased review of how the target audience suffers from this ongoing trouble. Once the empathising is done, there needs to be a collection of the user's needs and problems in the defined process by gathering the data from the empathise stage and analysing the problems for example creating user personas that describe the user's goals and characteristics. The third stage is to ideate, we are creating ideas and challenging assumptions by looking for alternative ways to view the problem and identify innovative solutions to the problem statement that has been created. Afterwards, the prototype stage involves making wireframes of the application that is sustainable for their needs. The last part of the process is to test the product to ensure the app is up to a high standard. (Conrick, K, 2020)

The agile design methodology will be combined with the Design thinking method. This will be carried out when it comes to the designing part of the prototyping stage, the agile design methodology will be involved in the mix. This method tends to be used on a regular basis as it allows researchers to create an application faster and meets the user's needs (Planview, n.d.). The pattern goes from planning, designing, developing, testing, deploying, reviewing and then launching the product. If the first time isn't enough for the user's needs still, which is usually the case, this pattern has to repeat again to adjust new changes and updates to make it better for the user. These repeats are known as sprints. (Wrike, 2022)

When it came to designing the application the agile thought process Throughout the making of the application was to think about what type of component would be beneficial for the users when it comes to budgeting efficiently. The Data Collecting we organised in the first assignment helped us understand what the users would go through when they would use other applications and see what those applications are lacking. The participants that took part in this questionnaire advised that it would be a good idea if the application had calendar reminders, income and expenses tracker, and statistics. This will help the users have a more visual idea of how much they’re spending and have all their balances, incomes, and expenses all in one app instead of. Spending money extravagantly on notepads' special software can generate their budget for them. It will also give them a better insight into how valuable money is. 

The agile methodology processor does not discontinue from there with this methodology it is like a constant cycle of always improving the application so with this application there are still improvements that need to be made. As the designer of this application, There had to be more research. This is where design thinking methodology gets involved, emphasising the user on a level where the researcher understands the user's needs. At this stage, another survey will send out to the same individuals that did participate in the previous survey and asked what other components can be included in the application and what improvements there could be. With this process the two combined together will make this application better in the future Since it is non-biased, suits the users needs, is regularly checked and updated, and will always evolve better with improved components tools or pages with better components tools or pages.


## Overall Conculsion & Results.

 As shown on the survey there are a lot of improvements as the application isn’t finished to a high standard due to time management issues and technical issues. The overall conclusion to this is to follow a better step-by-step plan so that time management is not affected throughout the project.
